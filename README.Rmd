The goal of CohortSymmetry is to carry out the necessary calculations for Sequence Symmetry Analysis (SSA). It is highly recommended that this method is tested beforehand against well-known positive benchmarks and negative benchmarks. Such benchmarks could be found using the paper in the Reference.
 
## Installation
 
You can install the development version of CohortSymmetry from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
 
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("oxford-pharmacoepi/CohortSymmetry")
```
 
## Example
### Create a reference to data in the OMOP CDM format 
The CohortSymmetry package is designed to work with data in the OMOP CDM (Common Data Model) format, so our first step is to create a reference to the data using the CDMConnector package.
 
As an example, we will be using Eunomia data set.
```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(CDMConnector)
library(dplyr)
library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
 
db <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), 
                     dbdir = CDMConnector::eunomia_dir())
cdm <- cdm_from_con(
  con = db,
  cdm_schema = "main",
  write_schema = "main"
)
```
 
### Step 0: Instantiate two cohorts in the cdm reference
 
This will be entirely user's choice on how to generate such cohorts. Minimally, this package requires two cohort tables in the cdm reference, namely the index_cohort and the marker_cohort.
 
If one wants to generate two drugs cohorts in cdm, DrugUtilisation is recommended. As an example, amiodarone and levothyroxine are used. This is a known positive benchmark reported in the literature.<sup>1</sup>
 
```{r Example - Step 0: Using DrugUtilisation, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(DrugUtilisation)
library(CodelistGenerator)
library(dplyr)
 
index_drug <- CodelistGenerator::getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm = cdm, name = "amiodarone")
marker_drug <- CodelistGenerator::getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm = cdm, name = "levothyroxine")
 
cdm <- DrugUtilisation::generateDrugUtilisationCohortSet(
    cdm = cdm,
    name = "cohort_index",
    conceptSet = index_drug
  )
 
cdm <- DrugUtilisation::generateDrugUtilisationCohortSet(
    cdm = cdm,
    name = "cohort_marker",
    conceptSet = marker_drug
  )
```
 
### Step 1: getCohortSequence
 
In order to initiate the calculations, the two cohorts tables need to be intersected using `getCohortSequence()` function. This process will filter out the individuals who appeared on both tables according to a user-specified parameters. This includes `timeGap`, `washoutWindow`, `indexMarkerGap` and `daysPriorObservation`. Details on 
these parameters could be found on the vignette.
 
```{r Step 1: getCohortSequence, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(CohortSymmetry)
 
cdm <- CohortSymmetry::getCohortSequence(cdm,
                   indexTable = "cohort_index",
                   markerTable = "cohort_marker",
                   name = "amiodarone_levothyroxine",
                   combinationWindow = c(0, Inf))
 
cdm$amiodarone_levothyroxine %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

### Step 2: getSequenceRatio
 
To get the sequence ratios, we would need the output of the getCohortSequence() function. 
The output of this process contains cSR(crude sequence ratio), aSR(adjusted sequence ratio) and confidence intervals.

```{r Step 2: getSequenceRatio, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
res <- CohortSymmetry::getSequenceRatios(cdm = cdm,
                                         sequenceCohortSet = "amiodarone_levothyroxine")
 
res %>% glimpse()
```
